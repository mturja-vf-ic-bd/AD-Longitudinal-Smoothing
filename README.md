# AD-Longitudinal-Smoothing
This is a project to make the longitudinal brain networks of a patient consistent in some sense. The longitudinal brain networks are generated from MRI scans. This scans contain noise. To analysis the change of brain network over time it is important to increase signal to noise ratio. We use some constraints on the generated brain network to accomplish this task.
